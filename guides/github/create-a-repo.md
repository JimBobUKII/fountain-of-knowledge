# Create a repository
To put your project up on GitHub, you'll need to create a repository for it to live in.

## Create a repo
You can store a variety of projects in GitHub repositories, including open source projects. With open source projects, you can share code to make better, more reliable software. You can use repositories to collaborate with others and track your work. For more information, see "About repositories."

> [!NOTE]
> Note: You can create public repositories for an open source project. When creating your public repository, make sure to include a license file that determines how you want your project to be shared with others. For more information on open source, specifically how to create and grow an open source project, we've created Open Source Guides that will help you foster a healthy open source community by recommending best practices for creating and maintaining repositories for your open source project. You can also take a free GitHub Learning Lab course on maintaining open source communities.

- In the upper-right corner of any page, use the '+' drop-down menu, and select **New repository**.
- Type a short, memorable name for your repository. For example, "hello-world".
- Optionally, add a description of your repository. For example, "My first repository on GitHub."
- Choose a repository visibility.
- Select Initialize this repository with a README.
- Click Create repository.

> [!TIP]
> Tip: You can also create repositories using the GitHub CLI. For more information, see "gh repo create" in the GitHub CLI documentation.

## Commit your first change
A commit is like a snapshot of all the files in your project at a particular point in time.

When you created your new repository, you initialized it with a README file. README files are a great place to describe your project in more detail, or add some documentation such as how to install or use your project. The contents of your README file are automatically shown on the front page of your repository.

Let's commit a change to the README file.

- In your repository's list of files, click **README.md**.
- On the **Edit file** tab, type some information about yourself.
- Above the new content, click **Preview changes**.
- Review the changes you made to the file. You'll see the new content in green.
- At the bottom of the page, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file. You can attribute the commit to more than one author in the commit message. For more information, see "Creating a commit with multiple co-authors."
- Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is the default branch, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit and then create a pull request.
- Click **Propose file change**.
